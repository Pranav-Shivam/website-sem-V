Processing

After you give blood, we begin testing and processing your blood so it can be used to give life. For each donation, blood samples are tested to make sure it can be transfused to patients safely.

Processing begins by separating the blood using a centrifuge. The centrifuge spins the blood, separating the components by density into three parts: red blood cells, plasma, and platelets. Each component is collected into a separate storage bag and stored in our monitored storage devices.
Transfusion

Transfusion is the process by which a doctor or medical professional prescribes blood products for a patient using blood donated by someone like you. On average, one in every seven hospital patients is in need of a life-saving blood transfusion.

Blood transfusions are commonly used for patients undergoing organ transplants, bone marrow transplants, heart surgery, burn treatments, or those who have been in an automobile accident. Cancer patients are one of the most common recipients of blood products.
