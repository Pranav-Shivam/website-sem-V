Donations and Iron Deficiency

Iron is important for making red blood cells and transporting oxygen. Loss of red blood cells through blood donation may deplete the body of iron over time, and frequent blood donors may become low on iron before becoming anemic. Young women are particularly at risk of low iron due to blood loss during their menstrual cycles. Diet alone may not be enough to replace iron, especially if you have gastrointestinal issues or do not eat red meat. If you think you may be at risk of low iron, you may consider calling your physician or taking an oral iron supplement. Do not take iron without consulting your doctor if you have any family history of too much iron in the body.
